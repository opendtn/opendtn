# dtn_web_server

This is a simple webnode to send DTN packages for testing. To test the app you need a webbrowser and a running server.

## Usage

Open a terminal and put in the following command:
```
~/opendtn$ ./build/bin/dtn_web_node 
```
This will start a small webserver listening on https://localhost:12345.
You may now use your webbrowser to connect a websession. 

Open a second terminal as the receiver of the message:
```
~/opendtn$ ./build/bin/dtn_web_node -c src/service/dtn_web_node/config/config.json 
```

Now open a webbrowser and connect to 
```
https://localhost:12345
```
This loads the CBOR Test page. You may send some packages to the test node and the test node dumps the packages.

The receiver will dump the message received.
